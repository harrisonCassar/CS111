Included Files:
-lab4b.c: C source file for an embedded application that polls, processes, and reports data from a temperature sensor at a regularly-timed interval, additionally taking in user input to modify behavior through the form of inputted commands and a GPIO-connected button.
-Makefile: a makefile to build and test the lab4b embedded application (intended to be executed on an embedded system). Higher level targets include:
	-default: builds the application, compiling with the -Wall and -Wextra options
	-check: executes an automated smoke-test of the built application to see if it runs and can talk to its sensors.
	-clean: delete all programs and output generated by the Makefile
	-dist: creates the deliverable tarball
