### Projects
| Project | Grade |
|---------|-------|
| 0       | 100   |
| 1A      | 93    |
| 1B      | 100   |
| 4A      | 100   |
| 2A      | 98    |
| 2B      | 92.5  |
| 4B      | 79*   | (check below)
| 3A      | 93    |
| 3B      | 98    |
| 4C      | 98    |

***NOTE:** Project 4B's lower score was checked with TA, but he never got back to me. Based on self-testing, I believe the issue lies
in the use of variable name "R" to represent the value of the thermoresistor internal to the thermometer sensor that we used for
testing. When instead using a different name, the readings from the thermometer were able to be changed upon a simple "heating/cooling"
of the physical sensor device being tested (whereas before with the use of "R" as the variable name, it seems nearly constant, which
causes several automated test cases to automatically fail despite potentially testing something else... such as a change in the scale between C and F, etc.).
The assumption is that "R" refers to another definition of some global constant or variable that was declared in some included library
that was unaccounted for. 

### Exams
Midterm --> 99/100

Final --> Opted out (end of quarter cancellations with regards to COVID-19 pandemic).
