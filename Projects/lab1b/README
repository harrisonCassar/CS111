Included Files:
-lab1b-client.c: C source code for lab1b-client executable, which fundamentally manages input from terminal and socket, sending terminal input to socket for transmission to a remote shell process, and sending socket output to the terminal display. Supports compression.
-lab1b-server.c: C source code for lab1b-server executable, which fundamentally manages input from socket and shell, sending output from a socket connected to a client to a child shell process, and sending shell process's output to the socket for tranmission to the remote terminal. Supports compression.
-Makefile: Makefile with targets default (build lab1b-client and lab1b-server executables), client (builds only lab1b-client executable), server (builds only lab1b-server executable), clean (cleans directory by deleting all files created by Makefile), and dist (builds distribution tarball).
