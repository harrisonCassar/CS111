Included Files:
-lab4c_tcp.c: C source file for an embedded application that polls, processes, and reports data from a temperature sensor at a regularly-timed interval, sending these temperature reports over a TCP socket to a server, as well as taking in input from the server
-lab4c_tls.c: C source file for an embedded application that polls, processes, and reports data from a temperature sensor at a regularly-timed interval, sending these temperature reports over an SSL socket to a server, as well as taking in input from the server
-Makefile: a makefile to build and test the tcp and tls lab4c applications (intended to be executed on an embedded system). Higher level targets include:
	-default: builds both applications (tcp and tls connection types), compiling with the -Wall and -Wextra options
	-clean: delete all programs and output generated by the Makefile
	-dist: creates the deliverable tarball
