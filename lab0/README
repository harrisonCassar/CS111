Included Files:
-lab0.c: C source code for lab0, which fundamentally copies stdin to stdout (unless input/output file is specified),
with some other functionalities.
-Makefile: Makefile with targets default (build lab0 executable), clean (cleans directory by deleting all files created by Makefile), dist (builds distribution tarball), and check (peforms smoke tests on lab0 executable).
-smoketest: used by Makefile's "check" target to perform smoke tests on lab0 executable.
-backtrace.png: screenshot of gdb output from segfault and its associated stack-trace output from using gdb's backtrace command
-breakpoint.png: screenshot of gdb output from setting breakpoint at variable assigment causing segfault and inspection of NULL pointer variable being dereferenced in assignment

Smoke-Test Cases:
-Test 1: Normal transferring of file from specified input and output files
-Test 2: Normal transferring of stdin to stdout
-Test 3: Properly handling unrecognized argument
-Test 4: Intentionally causes segfault when option specified
-Test 5: Catch intentionally-caused segfault when both options are specified
-Test 6: Correct handling of non-existant specified input file
-Test 7: Correct handling of non-writable output file

Resources:
-man pages for open, creat, close, dup, read, write, exit, signal
-man pages for perror, errno
-man pages for getopt, getopt_long, getopt.h
-GNU C library documentation, specifically section 25.2 "Parsing program options using getopt". Subsections 2 and 4 were used as example uses of getopt and getopt_long (https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Example-of-Getopt.html#Example-of-Getopt).
-Referenced example use code of signal(2) function from tutorialspoint.com (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_signal.htm)
-Referenced Caltech's CS11 article on how to properly format a usage statement with conventions (http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/general/usage.html)
-Referenced multiple forum posts/user replies describing that a segmentation fault has exit code of 139 (this was used for the sake of smoke testing)

Extra Info:
-confirmed proper version of gdb, gcc, and make by performing "which <command>" and "<command> -v".
